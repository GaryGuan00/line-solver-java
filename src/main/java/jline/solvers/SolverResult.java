  // setting to JLineMatrix objects is expensive if done many thousands of times, so storing the
  // time step data just once in a separate object is significantly more efficient than storing
  // multiple times. The row indices can be used to reference between the relevant performance
  // metric and 't' i.e. the value in row 150 in QNt was measured at the time step in row 150 in 't'
